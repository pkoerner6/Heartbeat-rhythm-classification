# Heartbeat rhythm classification from raw ECG signals

In this project, the focus shifts from medical image features to the classification of entire time series. The task at hand is the classification of raw Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into one of four classes. Unlike previous projects, you will be working directly with the original ECG recordings of varying lengths, sampled at 300Hz, aiming to predict heart rhythm.

## Data
The dataset consists of original ECG recordings sampled at 300Hz. Each recording may have varying lengths, and the goal is to accurately classify the heart rhythm based on the raw signal data.

## Classes
The four classes represent different heart rhythms. Accurate classification is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment.
